# Translations

Translations make this course reachable for learners who do not read English comfortably, and they are one of the most valuable contributions anyone can make here. Thank you for considering it.

## How translation contributions work

This course uses a two-tier rule, the same one as [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md):

- **Small fixes go straight to a pull request.** Typos, a mistranslated sentence, a broken link, one corrected paragraph in an existing translation: just open the PR.
- **A new language, or translating new lessons, starts with an issue.** Open an issue titled `Translation: <language>` saying which language you want to work on and roughly how much you can cover. A maintainer confirms nobody else is mid-way through the same language, and agrees the folder with you before you invest hours. This protects your time, not our turf.

## Structure

Each language gets a folder named by its language code, mirroring the English lesson folders:

```
translations/
  README.md        (this file)
  es/
    00-course-setup/
      README.md
    ...
  ur/
    ...
```

Translate the lesson README and the exercise first. Code comments can follow; runnable code itself stays identical so learners in every language run the same examples and reproduce the same numbers. Keep code, commands, file names, and variable names untranslated. Measured numbers stay exactly as the code produces them; translate the words around them, never round or improve a figure.

## Quality rules

- Accuracy beats fluency: a plainer sentence that matches the English meaning is better than an elegant one that drifts.
- Keep the plain-language style of the original: short sentences, no jargon without a definition, no em dashes.
- AI-assisted first drafts are welcome. Say so in the PR, and review the draft yourself before submitting; you are the quality bar, and you will be credited by name in the PR and the language folder.
- Translate the glossary ([resources/glossary.md](../resources/glossary.md)) early if you can: it unlocks consistent terminology for every later lesson in your language.
- Partial translations are fine and mergeable. A translated Module 0 helps learners today; nobody has to finish all 33 lessons to contribute.

## Credit

Translators are named in their language folder's README. If you would rather contribute anonymously, say so in the PR and we will honour it.
